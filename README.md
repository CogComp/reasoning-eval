# reasoning-eval

This is the GitHub Repo for paper "ReasonAgain: Using Extractable Symbolic Programs to Evaluate Mathematical Reasoning".

The perturbation data we generate in the paper is in the "data" folder.

To generate your own perturbations, please first run

    python generate_program.py
which will generate all the programs of questions. 
Then, please run 

    python run_program.py
to generate the perturbations. 

Feel free to leave any questions about the code or the implementation of the pipeline. Thanks!
